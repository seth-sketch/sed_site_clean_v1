Quick start

- Replace the placeholder logo at assets/sed-logo-tight.svg with your real SVG (keep the same filename).
- Replace hero slides in assets/hero/ and update the <script id="seSlidesJSON"> list in index.html.
  You can include .mp4/.mov and the hero will auto-use a <video>.
- Projects: edit assets/work.json and put images into assets/work/<slug>/. The grid and project pages use these.
- Press: edit assets/press.json; thumbs go in assets/press/.
- Splash shows once per session, then fades.
